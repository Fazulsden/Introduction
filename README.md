# Introduction
Hello there my name is fazulrehman nizamani, Computer science is a field that i think of as an innovation Mechanism. let it be any day of your life, i can bet that you would start your day of a technological device and end your day with technological device. For instance you are going to wake up on a alaram and most likely that alaram would have an processor. LEt it be your calculator or your alaram everything holds an processor now days on them. Apart from that i think so our whole life runs on patterns which are numerical, if i were to wake up, its going to be on a time, (time is number), if i were to paint i can make excellent paintings just by having excellent angels!
